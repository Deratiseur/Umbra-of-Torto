@99991 = ~Weird Ring~
@99992 = ~Wonder~
@99993 = ~For some reason, whenever your casual gaze rests upon this unremarkable ring, its smooth surface seems to shimmer with shifting hues, yet upon careful scrutiny nothing particularly distinctive is revealed.~
@99994 = ~Ring of Torto: Wonder

All of Torto is shrouded in a thick fog of mystery. No trace of it can be found in the mottled writings etched on ancient slabs, nor its melody in the fragmented verses of long-sung ballads. Even the very origin of Torto's name remains a subject of endless conjecture, with no definitive answer. Amidst the dust accumulated over countless ages, only Wonder persists, carrying faint echoes intimately tied to Torto. It is a lost memory, buried deep within the annals of time, like a slumbering dream awaiting the moment of its awakening.

This ring bears no inscription of powerful enchantments, nor is it suffused with arcane energies. It is so inconceivable that even the prophecies of the gods have failed to glimpse its existence. Thus, Wonder neither bestows upon its wearer boundless might nor promises pristine tranquility. Yet, if wielded properly, even without fully comprehending its true nature, considerable benefit can still be gleaned from it.
