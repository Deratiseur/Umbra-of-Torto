# Umbra of Torto

<samp>English | [简体中文](README_cn.md)</samp>

## Introduction

Are you prepared to embrace pure combat? You will step into a unique demiplane, akin to a "pocket dimension," where you'll challenge powerful extra-planar creatures. Conquer them, or perish within its depths - the choice is yours.

_Umbra of Torto_ is a quest mod for _Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition_, collaboratively developed by [The Ring of Wonder](https://trow.cc) gaming enthusiasts. However, due to the protracted pace of development, the production team has decided to release a relatively self-contained arena component as an early access preview, to sate the anticipation of those eagerly awaiting the full mod.
